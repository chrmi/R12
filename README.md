### Learn the basics of Computer Science and Memory Management.

[1] ~ [F] represent hexadecimal values which give corresponding points. If the score is divisible by 3, you gain a bonus point. If the score is divisible by 5, you gain 2 bonus points. If the score is divisible by both 3 and 5, you gain 3 bonus points, as well as the 1 and 2 bonus points, which often re-trigger further bonus.

The secondary goal is to gain as many points as possible; the primary goal is to dig into the code and write your own effects as a fun way to learn algorithms and computer science fundamentals.
